{"string1" : "One requirement is to apply a custom rules to the navigation element. For instance, lets say a client wants the link text changes from 'Exercises' to 'My Exercises'. Again, we could throw all these into a DB, do some out joins and bam! - we would have what we need. Since there is a limited number of these rules to save a network hop we threw these into a JSON structure as well. Interesting thing is that for a particular key, you could have multiple nodes you want updated. A very natural data structure is guava multimap where we can transform json to a multimap.",
